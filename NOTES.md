# Exploratory Testing Map Format

Exploratory testing is about learning the system while questioning it.
Documenting what you see, what you test, and what you question.

## 1. CHARTER
A single sentence defining what you're exploring and why.
**Format it as**: "Explore [area] to discover [information]."

## 2. TEST IDEAS
The mental models and test approaches you'll use. 
List specific heuristics (SFDPOT, Goldilocks, boundary analysis, etc.) or test idea patterns relevant to your charter.

## 3. EXECUTION NOTES
Actual areas/features/scenarios you covered during the session. 
Be specific about what you did, the data you used, and configurations tried.

## 4. BUGS/ISSUES FOUND
Problems discovered with enough detail to act on.
Include severity/priority indicators.

## 5. QUESTION/RISKS/FOLLOW-UPS
Things that need investigation, clarification from developers, or deeper testing later. 
Include blockers that stopped you from testing certain areas.

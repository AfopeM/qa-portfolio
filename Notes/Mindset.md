# MINDSET TIPS
Do not be vague, BE AS SPECIFIC AS POSSIBLE. Focus on logic, validation and system behaviour

- Identified things that could go wrong (even if they don't)
- Don’t assume “the app should do X”, assume “What if it doesn’t?”
- Think in extremes, not normal scenarios
- How can this break, confuse someone, expose data, miscalculate something or behave inconsistently
- Treat every user mistake as a possible breaking point
- Think about consequences, not just symptoms
- Think about security risk, data correctness, user trust, edge cases and failure on navigation path


## Questions to ask yourself:
- What would a malicious user try to do here?
- If the internet connection dropped right now, what would happen?
- What could go wrong ?
- If I were a new user, what would confuse me about this page?
- What happens if I do things in the 'wrong' order?
- What data does this form accept? What shouldn't it accept?
